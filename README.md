# Sketchi - A simple Etch-a-Sketch web app

I built this Sktechi while following The Odin Project, an online web development tutorial.

Sketchi allows a user to define a grid of between one and 99 cells.  The cells become increasingly darker as the cursor is passed over them, allowing a user to draw lines and shapes in the grid.

The user has a choice between a grey-scale and rainbow etch-a-sketch.  The rainbow version will pick a color at random to assign each cell when the cursor passes over it.  This color can then be made darker with subsequent passes.

The project can be found here: galenczk.github.io/Odin_etchASketch
Give it a try!

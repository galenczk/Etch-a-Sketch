Make a default grid appear on page load

Make the grid always square, regardless of window

Make the rainbow function "lock in" a color choice
for a given cell and darken that color on
subsequent mouseovers

Make "New" buttons smaller and "clear" bigger

Make background different than grid. Might need
different colors for rainbow vs BW
